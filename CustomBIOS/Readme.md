# CommunityContent: Custom Vircon32 BIOSes

This folder will contain custom BIOSes that can be used in Vircon32 emulators instead of the standard BIOS. Remember that a BIOS is expected to:

- Manage the console start-up
- Give a response to hardware errors
- Define an 10x20 pixels ASCII font (regions 0 to 255) to allow printing text
- Define a white pixel region (region 256) to allow drawing primitives
